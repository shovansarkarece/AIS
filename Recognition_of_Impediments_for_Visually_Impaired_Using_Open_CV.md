# Recognition of Impediments for Visually Impaired Using Open CV

- Abstract
This paper tackles the critical challenge of vision impairment, which impacts millions globally and makes everyday tasks difficult for those who are blind or have low vision. The proposed solution is a wearable visual aid designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate independently without relying on external help. Using real-time object detection, the system identifies obstacles and conveys their locations via voice output. Developed on the OpenCV platform using Python and implemented on a Raspberry Pi 3 model-B, the system achieves an 80% accuracy in text recognition and 90% in object detection.

Introduction
Vision is essential for human independence, yet millions experience visual impairment, leading them to depend on others for assistance. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 253 million people have some level of visual impairment, with 36 million affected by complete blindness. Major causes include chronic eye conditions and uncorrected refractive issues. Traditional aids like canes offer limited help as they do not assist with object recognition, which is essential for safe navigation. This proposed device seeks to improve the lives of visually impaired individuals by using a camera to detect obstacles and traffic signals, alerting users to potential hazards and helping them understand their surroundings.

Conclusion
The study concludes that the proposed system successfully assists visually impaired users in identifying obstacles and reading text, supporting safer, more informed decision-making during movement. A push switch initiates text identification and text-to-speech features, designed to be lightweight and user-friendly for comfort. Future improvements include integrating a smart navigation system that would allow visually impaired users to travel independently without relying on maps.
