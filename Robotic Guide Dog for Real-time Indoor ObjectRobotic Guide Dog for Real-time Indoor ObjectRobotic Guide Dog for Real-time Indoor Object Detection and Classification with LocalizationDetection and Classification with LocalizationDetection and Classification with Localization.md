- Abstract
This paper presents a robotic guide dog system developed to support vision-impaired individuals (VIPs) by leveraging advanced sensing capabilities. The system integrates a sensing module with the YOLO-GUIDE framework, enabling real-time object detection, classification, and localization within indoor settings. The system's effectiveness was evaluated with ten common indoor objects, yielding promising results with a Precision of 0.76, Recall of 0.67, and an F1-score of 0.71. Notably, the YOLO-GUIDE framework surpassed other models, confirming its suitability for this application.

Introduction
The research makes several significant contributions, including the development of a sensing module integrated with a quadrupedal robot for real-time visual data acquisition and the creation of the YOLO-GUIDE framework for real-time object detection and multi-label classification with localization. The system’s high performance was verified through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, where YOLO-GUIDE was shown to outperform other models. The paper underscores the critical role of object detection and classification in robotic guide dogs, as these abilities are vital for empowering VIPs to navigate independently and confidently. The authors collaborated with Guide Dogs NSW/ACT to assess the functional requirements of mobility aids and cutting-edge robotic technology, aiming to design a practical tool for daily mobility tasks. They also highlight the increasing affordability of commercial quadrupedal robots, which can serve as effective platforms for this guide dog technology.

Conclusion and Future Work
The conclusion reinforces the effectiveness of the proposed robotic guide dog system, which demonstrates successful real-time object detection and classification in indoor environments. Quantitative results confirm the system’s robust performance, with the YOLO-GUIDE framework outperforming alternative models. Future work will aim to increase the variety of object classes the system can recognize and incorporate object distance estimation to enhance its overall functionality.
